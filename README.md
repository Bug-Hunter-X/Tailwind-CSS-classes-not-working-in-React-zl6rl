# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working in React
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS in React projects: Tailwind classes failing to apply styles.  The problem often stems from improper configuration or build processes.

## Description
The `bug.js` file shows a React component that attempts to use Tailwind CSS classes (`bg-gray-200`, `text-3xl`, `font-bold`, `underline`). However, these styles might not be correctly applied, resulting in the component rendering without the expected styling. 

## Solution
The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` showcases the corrected implementation.  This involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly integrated into your React project and your build process handles the transformation of Tailwind directives.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `bug.js` and run a build command (using your preferred build tool, like Webpack or Vite).  
3. Observe the rendered output in your browser. The original implementation (`bug.js`) will show styling issues. 
4. Next, replace the contents of the relevant file with those from `bugSolution.js` and rebuild your project.  The corrected implementation should display the styling correctly.
